This is a Laptop Price Predictor Regression Project.


### Python Libraries-
1. ColumnTransformer: A tool to apply various data transformations to specific columns in a dataset.

2. Pipeline: Sequentially chains together data preprocessing and modeling steps.

3. OneHotEncoder: Converts categorical variables into binary vectors for machine learning.

4. r2_score: A measure of how well a regression model fits the data.

5. mean_absolute_error: Measures average difference between predicted and actual values.

6. LinearRegression: A model that fits a linear relationship to data.

7. Ridge: Linear regression with added regularization to prevent overfitting.

8. Lasso: Linear regression with regularization, also performs feature selection.

9. KNeighborsRegressor: Predicts based on average of nearest neighbors' values.

10. DecisionTreeRegressor: Predicts by partitioning data into regions using a tree structure.

11. RandomForestRegressor: Ensemble model of multiple decision trees for better predictions.

12. GradientBoostingRegressor: Sequential ensemble of trees, correcting errors of predecessors.

13. AdaBoostRegressor: Ensemble method giving more weight to misclassified instances.

14. ExtraTreesRegressor: Ensemble of randomized decision trees for improved robustness.

15. SVR: Regression using Support Vector Machine principles.

16. XGBRegressor: Efficient gradient boosting algorithm for regression.

17. VotingRegressor: Ensemble method averaging predictions from multiple models.

18. StackingRegressor: Ensemble technique using a meta-model to combine predictions.

19. pickle: Python module for saving and loading objects, like models.
